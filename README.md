# climpred CESM1 S2S Analysis

This repository holds a few notebooks to demonstrate how to generate anomalies from the raw CESM1-SubX S2S output and then use `climpred` to verify them against ERA5 data. 

Note that this showcases the procedure on Cheyenne/Casper, where `dask` workers were optimized for that infrastructure and I point to files on our storage system.

## Steps

If you don't have miniconda or anaconda installed in your home environment, you should do so.

1. Download the latest `miniconda` for Linux 64-bit: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.
2. `scp` the bash installed to your work or home directory on Cheyenne.
3. Run `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` to install miniconda to your command line.
4. During installation, allow it to edit your path in `~/.bashrc`. Restart your instance or do `source ~/.bashrc` and make sure that `conda --help` runs. If it doesn't, add `conda` to your path. (E.g., https://askubuntu.com/questions/849470/how-do-i-activate-a-conda-environment-in-my-bashrc)

Now that you have conda installed on your command line, clone this repository to your work directory and navigate there. Run `conda env update -f environment.yml` and it will install all the required packages under an environment called "S2S". When you open https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/ and create a new notebook, you should see a grid tile for the S2S environment.

**When running all of these notebooks, click the drop-down menu in the top right and change the environment to the S2S environment**

## Figures
